Producer thread 1 joined successfully
Producer thread 2 joined successfully
Signaled that production is done
Consumer 1 finished (consumed 5 items)

=== Final Statistics ===
Items remaining in buffer: 0
Buffer contents: 

=== Test completed successfully ===

The exact order of operations may vary due to thread scheduling, but the general flow will be:
The program initializes the shared buffer, mutex, and condition variables
Two producer threads and two consumer threads are created
Producers add items to the buffer (each producer adds 5 items)
Consumers remove items from the buffer
When the buffer is full, producers wait on the not_full condition
When the buffer is empty, consumers wait on the not_empty condition
After producers finish, the main thread signals that production is done
Consumers finish consuming any remaining items and exit
The program prints final statistics and cleans up resources
The output demonstrates proper synchronization between threads using mutexes and condition variables, showing how producers wait when the buffer is full and consumers wait when the buffer is empty.
